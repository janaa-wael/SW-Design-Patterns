# Façade Pattern

## * Definition

The Façade Pattern is a design pattern in software engineering that falls under the structural pattern category. It provides a simplified and unified interface to a set of interfaces or subsystems within a larger system, making it easier to use and reducing the complexity of the system for clients. Essentially, it acts as a facade or entry point to a more complex system, shielding clients from its intricacies.

## * Intent

- Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
- Façade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
- Wrap a complicated subsystem with a simpler interface.

## * Structure

## * Pros

-  You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem.

## * Cons

-  A façade can become an all-knowing object coupled to all classes of an app.
